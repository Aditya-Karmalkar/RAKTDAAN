# üéØ Location-Based SOS Alert System

## New Features Implemented

### **üè• Enhanced Hospital SOS Alerts**

**Hospitals can now send targeted SOS alerts to nearby areas with:**

1. **Geographic Targeting**

   - Target specific neighborhoods/areas (e.g., "Manhattan", "Downtown")
   - Set custom radius from 10km (very local) to 200km (state-wide)
   - Smart location matching based on hospital and donor locations

2. **Real-Time Donor Notification Count**

   - See exactly how many compatible donors will receive the alert
   - Blood group filtering ensures only compatible donors are notified
   - Location filtering shows only nearby available donors

3. **Enhanced SOS Alert Form**
   - New "Location Targeting" section with area and radius options
   - Dynamic preview showing target area and expected donor count
   - Better visual feedback about alert reach

### **ü©∏ Smart Donor Alert Filtering**

**Donors now receive only relevant alerts:**

1. **Location-Based Filtering**

   - Only see alerts from hospitals in their area
   - Proximity-based alert prioritization
   - Target area matching (if hospital specifies specific neighborhoods)

2. **Blood Compatibility Matching**

   - Automatic filtering by blood group compatibility
   - Universal donors (O+, O-) see more alerts
   - AB+ recipients can receive from anyone

3. **Priority Sorting**
   - Critical alerts appear first
   - Nearby hospitals prioritized
   - Recent alerts shown first within same urgency level

## Technical Implementation

### **Database Schema Updates**

- Added `targetArea` field for specific area targeting
- Added `radiusKm` field for geographic radius
- Added `notificationsSent` counter for tracking
- Added location index for better querying

### **New API Functions**

1. **Enhanced `createSosAlert`**

   - Accepts targetArea and radiusKm parameters
   - Counts compatible donors in target area
   - Returns notification count to hospital

2. **New `getNearbyActiveSosAlerts`**
   - Filters alerts by donor location and blood compatibility
   - Sorts by urgency and proximity
   - Returns alerts with hospital details

## How to Test

### **Hospital Testing:**

1. Sign up as `hospital1@test.com` / `password123`
2. Register with location "New York, NY"
3. Create SOS Alert:
   - Blood Group: O+
   - Urgency: Critical
   - Target Area: "Manhattan"
   - Radius: 25km
4. See notification count: "12 nearby O+ donors notified"

### **Donor Testing:**

1. Sign up as `donor1@test.com` / `password123`
2. Register with:
   - Blood Group: O+
   - Location: "New York, NY" (or "Manhattan, NY")
3. Go to "Live Alerts"
4. See the hospital's SOS alert (filtered by location + blood type)

### **Cross-Testing:**

- Create donors in different cities - they won't see NYC hospital alerts
- Create donors with different blood types - they won't see incompatible alerts
- Test different radius settings (10km vs 100km)
- Test specific area targeting vs city-wide alerts

## Benefits

### **For Hospitals:**

- ‚úÖ **Targeted reach** - alerts go to donors who can actually help
- ‚úÖ **Better response rates** - nearby donors are more likely to respond
- ‚úÖ **Real-time feedback** - know how many donors will see the alert
- ‚úÖ **Reduced noise** - don't spam irrelevant donors

### **For Donors:**

- ‚úÖ **Relevant alerts only** - see emergencies they can help with
- ‚úÖ **Location proximity** - alerts from nearby hospitals prioritized
- ‚úÖ **Blood compatibility** - no irrelevant blood type requests
- ‚úÖ **Better user experience** - less noise, more actionable alerts

### **System-wide:**

- ‚úÖ **Improved efficiency** - better matching between supply and demand
- ‚úÖ **Faster response times** - targeted alerts reach the right people
- ‚úÖ **Reduced spam** - smart filtering prevents alert fatigue
- ‚úÖ **Geographic optimization** - location-aware emergency response

## Future Enhancements

1. **GPS-based targeting** - Use exact coordinates for precise radius calculations
2. **Traffic-aware routing** - Consider travel time, not just distance
3. **Donor preferences** - Let donors set max travel distance preferences
4. **Hospital networks** - Allow hospitals to share alerts within hospital groups
5. **Emergency escalation** - Auto-expand radius for critical alerts with low response
