# üîß Netlify Secrets Scanning Fix Summary

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Secrets Scanning Configuration**

- Added `SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_KEYS` to `netlify.toml`
- Configured to allow Firebase API keys and Convex URLs in environment variables

### 2. **Removed Hardcoded Secrets**

- Updated `src/firebase/config.ts` to remove hardcoded Firebase API keys
- Added proper environment variable validation
- Removed fallback secrets that were being detected

### 3. **Build Artifacts Cleaned**

- Removed old `dist/` folder containing embedded secrets
- Rebuilt project with clean environment variable handling

### 4. **Updated .gitignore**

- Added environment files to prevent accidental commits
- Added Convex-specific ignores

## üîê Security Improvements

### Environment Variable Validation

- Both Firebase and Convex configurations now validate required environment variables
- Development fallbacks use generic values, not real secrets
- Production builds fail fast if environment variables are missing

### Secrets Management

- All secrets now come from Netlify environment variables only
- No hardcoded fallbacks in production builds
- Proper error handling for missing configuration

## üöÄ Ready for Deployment

Your project is now properly configured for Netlify deployment:

1. **Secrets scanning is configured** to allow necessary environment variables
2. **No hardcoded secrets** in the codebase or build artifacts
3. **Environment variables are validated** at runtime
4. **Build process is clean** and security-compliant

## üìã Environment Variables Required in Netlify

Set these in Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables:

```
VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment-name.convex.cloud
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
```

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Deploy again** using `netlify deploy --prod`
2. **Or** push to your Git repository if using Git integration
3. The secrets scanning error should now be resolved

## ‚úÖ Verification

Run `npm run deploy-check` to verify your setup before deployment.
